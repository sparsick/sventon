<p>Provides a (mostly native, using JNI and javah) implementation of
a high level Java API for
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>.  JavaHL was originally
targeted for implementors of GUI clients and IDE plug-ins, and currently
provides a minimal-but-complete set of APIs which expose the core Subversion C
API to Java.  It requires a JRE 1.2+ (runtime).</p>

<p>It is currently quite mature, and can be considered for production use.</p>
