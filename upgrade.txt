UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS SVENTON VERSION

The cache implementation and the configuration property file format
has changed between sventon version 2.5.0 and 2.5.1. This means that
sventon may re-index your repository.

Follow these steps for a smooth upgrade.

1. Stop the servlet container.
2. Locate the container's temp directory and the sub directory 'sventon_config'.
3. View the contents of the configuration file 'sventon.properties' located
   in the 'repositories' sub directory and write down the info somewhere, as
   you will need it during setup of your new sventon instance.
4. Delete the entire directory 'sventon_config' including it's sub directories.
5. Delete the old compiled and cached JSP pages from your container's
   work directory (usually work/Catalina/localhost/svn on Tomcat).
6. Replace the old svn.war file in the container's webapps install folder
   with a new one downloaded from www.sventon.org.
7. Start the servlet container.
8. Browse to http://your-server/svn/ and start the configuration.

If the repository cache has been enabled during setup, the background
cache/indexing process of the revisions and the files in HEAD will start.
If you have a repository with many files (and/or tags or branches),
this can take quite some time. You will be able to use sventon during the
indexing process, but the search and flatten buttons will be disabled until
indexing is completed.
