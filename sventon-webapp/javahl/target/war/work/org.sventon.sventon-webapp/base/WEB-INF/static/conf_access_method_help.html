  <b>A note about security</b>
</p>
<p>
  When using the
  <i>shared</i> access method the username and password is stored together with other sventon config information.
  In a production situation you may want to take appropriate measures to secure this data.
</p>
<p>
  Enabling user based access control stores username and password in the user session, this could
  be considered a security problem.
